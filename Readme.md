## What is Statium?
Statium's mission is to provide an easy to use tool for planned contrast analysis. It is inspired by the [Psy Statistical Package](http://www.psy.unsw.edu.au/research/research-tools/psy-statistical-program) and can be used for single factor designs, and also two-factor designs with one between-subject and one within-subject factor.

## Frameworks
Front-end component of Statium is based on [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)
Back-end component is based on [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
