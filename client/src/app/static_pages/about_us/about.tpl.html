            <em>Statium's</em> mission is to provide an easy to use tool for planned contrast analysis. It is inspired by the
            <a href="http://www.psy.unsw.edu.au/research/research-tools/psy-statistical-program" target="_blank">Psy Statistical Package</a> and
            can be used for single factor designs, and also two-factor designs with one
            between-subject and one within-subject factor.
